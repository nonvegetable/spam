Spam.py
=======

Description:
------------

`spam.py` is a Python script designed to automate the process of sending repetitive messages through keyboard input. It utilizes the PyAutoGUI library to simulate keyboard typing and sending messages at specified intervals.

Usage:
------

1.  **Installation:**
    
    *   Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    *   Install the PyAutoGUI library using pip:
        
        Copy code
        
        `pip install pyautogui`
        
2.  **Setup:**
    
    *   Open `spam.py` in a text editor or Python IDE of your choice.
    *   Customize the script by specifying the number of times to send the message (`limit`) and the message content (`message`).
3.  **Execution:**
    
    *   Run the script by executing `spam.py` using Python:
        
        Copy code
        
        `python spam.py`
        
    *   After running the script, you'll have a 5-second delay to position your cursor in the text input area where you want the messages to be sent.
4.  **Caution:**
    
    *   Use this script responsibly and ethically. Automated messaging can be considered spam and may violate terms of service on certain platforms.
    *   Ensure that the target application or platform allows automated input, as some may have protections against it.
